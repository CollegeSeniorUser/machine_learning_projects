# Feature Processing for Logistic Classification Project
- Task goal: classification of time series. In this project, we will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network
---
- Data:
  - Dataset Structure:
    - 7 folders, each representing a different human activity. Each folder contains multiple files, each corresponding to a single instance of an activity.
  - Time Series Data:
    - Each file records 6 time series from the same person: avg rss12, var rss12, avg rss13, var rss13, avg rss23, and var rss23.
      - Each instance consists of 480 consecutive values per time series.
  - Dataset Size: total of 88 instances, each containing 6 time series.
