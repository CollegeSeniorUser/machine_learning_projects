# Combined Cycle Power Plant Prediction (Linear/Polynomial Regression)
- Task goal: to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using multiple ambient environmental factors.
---
- Dataset: the dataset contains 6 years (2006-2011) of power plant data. It includes hourly average readings of four independent variables (predictors):
  - Independent varaibles: Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Exhaust Vacuum (V) (float/int)
  - Dependent variable: net hourly electrical energy output (EP). (Float/Int)

-  Methodology
    - Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset, create pairwise scatterplots, and compute summary statistics
    - Simple Linear Regression: Fit a separate regression model for each predictor to check individual impact on EP.
    - Multiple Linear Regression: Fit a model using all predictors together and analyze statistical significance.
    - Nonlinearity and Interaction Analysis: check for nonlinear relationships by fitting polynomial regression models.
    - Test interaction terms between predictors to improve the model.
    - Model Comparison: Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on training and test sets.

- Algorithm
  - sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor, sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression  
  - Linear Regression:
    - Univariate models (one predictor at a time).
    - Multivariate models (all predictors together).
  - Polynomial Regression:
    - Adding quadratic and cubic terms to capture nonlinearity.
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression:
    - Implement KNN with normalized and raw features.
    - Tune k (neighbors) from 1 to 100 and find the optimal value.
    - Compare results with Linear Regression using test errors.
