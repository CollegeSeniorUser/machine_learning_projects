- project1: (KNN) binary classification problem where we determine whether a patient has an abnormal spinal condition (AB) or a normal spine (NO) with 6 attributes. 
- project2: Linear/Polynomial Regression (predict the net hourly electrical energy output Power Plant using multiple ambient environmental factors)
- project3: Feature Processing for Logistic Classification Project (motion sensor/human activity classification)
- Project5 Task1: (Classification) Develop decision trees and optimize with pruning for medical diagnosis
- Project5 Task2: Optimize regression models to predict crime rates in different communities using LASSO, Principal Component Regression (PCR), Ridge Regression, and XGBoost
